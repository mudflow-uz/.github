# Mudflow.uz

**Mudflow.uz** is an innovative project aimed at detecting and predicting mudflows (seli) in hazardous regions of Uzbekistan. By deploying microchips in critical locations, we gather real-time data on environmental conditions and issue early warnings to help prevent disasters and save lives. In the future, we plan to integrate predictive modeling to enhance the system's accuracy and forecasting capabilities.

## Project Overview

Mudflows, or seli, are one of the most dangerous natural disasters in the mountainous regions of Uzbekistan. They pose significant threats to lives and infrastructure, especially in rural areas where early detection is critical.

**Mudflow.uz** is designed to tackle this issue by:
- **Monitoring** environmental conditions in real-time using microchips installed in high-risk areas.
- **Notifying** authorities and the local population when a potential mudflow is detected.
- **Predicting** future mudflow occurrences based on the data collected, using advanced machine learning models (upcoming).

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Microchips gather real-time environmental data, including water levels, soil moisture, and vibrations.
- **Instant Notifications**: When dangerous conditions are detected, the system sends notifications via mobile alerts, email, or SMS.
- **API for Data Access**: Provide open access to the collected data for integration into other platforms.
- **Predictive Modeling (Coming Soon)**: Machine learning models will predict future mudflow events based on historical data.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: 
  - Node.js (for real-time data processing and API handling)
  - Flask (for machine learning model integration)
  
- **Frontend**: React.js (future integration for visualization and user notifications)
  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for storing environmental data)
  
- **Hardware**: Custom microchips placed in hazard-prone areas
